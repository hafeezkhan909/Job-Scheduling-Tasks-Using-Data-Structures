# Job-Scheduling-Tasks-Using-Data-Structures
The operating system provides a range of functions that include memory management, file management, I/O management, process management, networking, protection and interpreter systems. Process management is the most important function in these functions since an operating system is a system program that interacts with hardware during runtime. Scheduling algorithms are required for managing processes and play an important role in assigning resources to them for their execution. They determine how much CPU time must be allocated to the processes. The main objective of them is to attain high utilization of the system resources, taking in account the priority of the user corresponding to it and deadlines for the job. A process requires both, CPU time and I/O time for its execution. In a multi-programming system, a single process utilizes CPU while the other process is waiting for I/O. But in a uni-programming system, the entire time is misspent in waiting for I/O, even though CPU is unoccupied during that period. The goal of the process scheduling algorithms is to wisely utilize the CPU resources and maximize throughput while maintaining the waiting time low.
